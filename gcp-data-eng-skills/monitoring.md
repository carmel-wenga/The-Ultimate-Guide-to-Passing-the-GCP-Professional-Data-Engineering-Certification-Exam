# Monitoring

## General Concepts
* Monitoring: Understand business reliability requirements and choose the right metric to meet the requirement

## Cloud Profiler
* Cloud Profiler: Analyze CPU and Memory usage to identify resource-intensive parts of data processing jobs.

## Cloud Trace
* Cloud Trace: Analyze latency data to identify slow microservice operations.

## Cloud Audit Logs
* Cloud Audit Logs: Enable and review Data Access audit logs to monitor object access in Cloud Storage.
* Cloud Audit Logs: Monitor access and policy compliance for BigQuery usage.
* Cloud Audit Logs: Track access to BigQuery datasets to identify who is using which data.

## Cloud Logging
* Cloud Logging: Analyze logs to detect errors after pipeline deployments.
* Cloud Logging: Configure log exports to extend retention beyond default periods.
* Cloud Logging: Create a project sink with advanced log filter when a specific BigQuery table is updated with new data.
* Cloud Logging: Create an aggregated export sink for centralized log management.
* Cloud Logging: Export logs to BigQuery for long-term storage and analysis.
* Cloud Logging: Record custom logs to better understand application behavior and diagnose failures.
* Cloud Logging: Search event data to identify root causes of application failures.
* Cloud Logging: Store and manage log data with minimal administrative overhead using a managed service.
* Cloud Logging: Understand the default retention periods for each types of logs such as Admin activity audit logs, system event audit logs, access transparency logs, and data access audit logs.
* Cloud Logging: Utilize Data Access logs for auditing user access to BigQuery datasets.
* Cloud Logging: View logs captured from applications to diagnose issues before a crash.

## Cloud Monitoring

* Cloud Monitoring: Set up alerts based on system lag for proactive issue tracking.
* Cloud Monitoring: Set up alerts to detect anomalies in data processing pipelines by collecting metrics from other services like Cloud Pub/Sub or Cloud Storage.
* Cloud Monitoring: Set up alerts to monitor task performance and SLA compliance.
* Cloud Monitoring: Set up dashboards to track slot utilization and identify bottlenecks in BigQuery.
* Cloud Monitoring: Track BigQuery slot utilization metrics to understand resource usage patterns.
* Cloud Monitoring: Track Dataflow job executions to correlate with data increases.
* Cloud Monitoring: Track Pub/Sub metrics for insights on message processing failures.
* Cloud Monitoring: Track storage utilization of a Bigtable cluster to decide when to increase cluster capacity.
* Cloud Monitoring: Use Cloud Monitoring Agent and Configure MySQL plugin to collect MariaDB metrics with minimal development effort.
* Cloud Monitoring: Use Cloud Monitoring for creating dashboards and setting up alerts for system metrics.
* Cloud Monitoring: Use Metrics Explorer to gather utilization information for BigQuery reservations.
