# Data Access & Security

## General Concepts
* Data Access & Security: Ensure secure data transfer by managing network rules restricting external IP access.
* Data Access & Security: Understand all the data encryption level at Google Cloud
* Data Access & Security: Understand How Google Cloud encrypts data at rest.
* Data Access & Security: Understand how Google Cloud secure Data Encryption Key (DEK) with Key Encryption Key (KEK)
* Data Access & Security: Understand the difference between Application, Platform, Infrastructure, and Hardware data encryption level. 
* Data Access & Security: Understand the difference between IP Allowlisting, NAT Gatewaya and Forward SSH Tunnel and how to use them.
* Data Access & Security: Understand what is "Trust No One" (TNO) and Zero Trust approach to encrypt data.

## Cloud EKM (External Key Manager)
* Cloud EKM: Integrate external encryption keys from on-premises HSMs with Google Cloud services.
* Cloud EKM: Integrate with external key management partners for secure key retrieval.
* Cloud EKM: Manage access to externally managed keys stored outside Google Cloud.

## Cloud IAM (Identity & Access Management)
* Cloud IAM: Apply least privilege principle by granting only necessary roles and permissions.
* Cloud IAM: Apply organizational policies at the correct level of resource hierarchy for efficient policy management and compliance.
* Cloud IAM: Assign appropriate IAM roles for department or users the corresponding modify dataset.
* Cloud IAM: Assign appropriate roles to control access for each  users or service accounts.
* Cloud IAM: Assign primitive roles to manage basic access in development environments with minimal administrative overhead.
* Cloud IAM: Assign roles for accessing Cloud Storage with the principle of least privilege.
* Cloud IAM: Assign roles to control data access for different teams.
* Cloud IAM: Assign roles with least privilege principle for secure access and job execution.
* Cloud IAM: Create an Manage Service Accounts
* Cloud IAM: Create custom roles to grant specific permissions tailored to user needs.
* Cloud IAM: Implement access controls using hierarchical resource structure for policy inheritance.
* Cloud IAM: Implement policies to restrict access based on resource location.
* Cloud IAM: Implement resource hierarchy to leverage policy inheritance and simplify access management.
* Cloud IAM: Implement the principle of least privilege by granting only necessary permissions for tasks.
* Cloud IAM: Manage access and authenticate applications using service accounts for secure data retrieval.
* Cloud IAM: Manage BigQuery API access via roles and policies for approved users.
* Cloud IAM: Restrict access using roles to ensure security of audit logs.
* Cloud IAM: Set bucket-level access permissions for comprehensive management.
* Cloud IAM: Understand the difference between Users, Group, Service Accounts.
* Cloud IAM: Understand the interaction between IAM and ACLs for effective access control.
* Cloud IAM: Use groups to manage user access efficiently by associating them with specific policies.
* Cloud IAM: Use hierarchy to inherit department-specific policies from folders to associated projects.
* Cloud IAM: Use service accounts and groups to control access based on the principle of least privilege.
* Cloud IAM: Use Service Accounts to manage secure access to GCP resources without individual user authentication.

* Cloud KMS: Manage encryption keys to comply with organizational security policies.
* Cloud KMS: Manage encryption keys using Cloud External Key Management integration.
* Cloud KMS: Understand how to deal with key exposure and how to re-encrypt data that was previously exposed.
* Cloud KMS: Understand what is Additional authenticated data (AAD) and how to use when encrpyting data.
* Cloud KMS: Understand what is Customer-Supplied Encryption Key (CSEK) and how to use it to encrypt Cloud Storage files and Buckets.
